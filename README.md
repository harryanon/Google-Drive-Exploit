**full name disclosure information leak in google drive**

in 2015 i discovered and reported this exploit found in both mapsengine and drive. mapsengine was patched, but it was evidently a feature in drive. many email accounts across several providers whose names aren't visible on g+ or in account recovery procedures become retrievable. this issue was disclosed to google back in 2015.
