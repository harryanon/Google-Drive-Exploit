# google-drive-exploit
active exploit leaking full names associated with some email addresses including but not limited to gmail

in 2015 i discovered this exploit in both google mapsengine and google drive.

mapsengine was patched, but it was evidently a feature in drive.

many email addresses whose names aren't accessible through "forgot password" procedures become accessible.
