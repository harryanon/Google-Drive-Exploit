in 2015 i discovered this exploit in both google mapsengine and google drive. mapsengine was patched, but it was evidently a feature in drive. many email accounts across several providers whose names aren't accessible through "forgot password" procedures become retrievable.

how to install and use:

1. use google developers console to generate api credentials *after enabling drive api* on a new project
2. edit index.php with clientid, clientsecret and redirecturi values
3. your redirecturi value must be the url that points to index.php.

lulz full disclosure
