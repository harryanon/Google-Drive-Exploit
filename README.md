in 2015 i discovered this exploit in both google mapsengine and google drive. mapsengine was patched, but it was evidently a feature in drive. many email accounts across several providers whose names aren't accessible through "forgot password" procedures become retrievable.

instructions

using google developers console, generate api credentials after enabling drive api on a new project edit this file with said credentials (i.e. clientid, clientsecret, redirecturi) your redirecturi must point to /index.php

lulz full disclosure
